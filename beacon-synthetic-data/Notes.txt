synthetic1 dataset was generated from the 1000 Genomes Project VCF files.

We chose the variants using coordinates of genes that can be found inside of genes.bed

minisynthetic1 has only gene ANGPTL6

minisynthetic1 is was used for our demo

minisynthetic1 has 46 genomic variants

We used beacon2-ri-tools2 to generate the genomicVariants.json files
We used in house scripts to generate the other json files
