# SemanticBeacon
A framework to allow federated SPARQL queries with genomic variants and public knowlegde graphs

In this repo, we show code supporting our paper submitted at SWAT4HCLS 2025: 
 - An RML mapping
 - Beacon sample response
 - The transformed response in RDF, following FALDO, GENO, and SO ontologies
 - A federated SPARQL query showcasing how to combine UniprotKB, Wikidata and genomic Beacon content
